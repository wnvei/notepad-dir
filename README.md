# Notiqo
Notiqo is an online collaborative notepad that allows users to edit in real time. No signups or accounts are required. You can just enter a code and start working on your notepad. Notiqo also allows features like private rooms, where only the user(s) with the password can edit that particular notepad, while others can only view the content. The interface is pretty minimalistic, so users can easily navigate their way through the website.
